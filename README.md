# **VirtualDopamine**

**Virtual Dopamine** is an app that helps you finish the rather boring activities you have to get done daily. It works in the same way as the Todo App but with some modifications. Every time you complete a task, the app plays a warm chime. Finishing all the tasks for the day plays a small melody. All of these things, encourage the brain to finish these tasks just for the pleasure of checking them off the list. I also added a widget that displays a random unchecked task. Every day the tasks are unchecked, and if you added a one-time task(purple), they will be removed from the list automatically. Adding tasks is basically identical to the TodoApp AddTodoView You can manually delete tasks by swiping right.

Last working code(sorry)

I also added some other files for the base design that you can add the code to easily(Sorry again for the trouble)
